# PROBLEM
# Write a function that takes a year as input and returns the century. 
# The return value should be a string that begins with the century 
# number, and ends with 'st', 'nd', 'rd', or 'th' as appropriate for 
# that number.

# New centuries begin in years that end with 01. So, the years 1901 - 
# 2000 comprise the 20th century.
